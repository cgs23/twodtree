## 2D Tree Java Implementation


This is a Java implementation of the popular Princeton university programming assignment, with custom Point and Rectangle classes.

You can find more information regarding the assignment [here](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr13/cos226/assignments/kdtree.html).

It includes a main function which reads an input file (example included in the repo) so you can initialize a tree quickly and perform actions on it from the cmd, such as insertion, find closest neighboring point, query rectangle and more.
